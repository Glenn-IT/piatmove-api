\# PiatMove — Development Guide



\## What We're Building



```

xampp/htdocs/

├── piatmove-api/        ← PHP REST API (used by Android apps + admin panel)

└── PiatMoveAdmin/       ← PHP web admin dashboard

```



The API comes \*\*first\*\* — the admin panel and Android apps both depend on it.



\---



\## Build Order



\### Step 1 — Database (MySQL via phpMyAdmin)



Create the `piatmove` database with these tables:



| Table | Purpose |

|---|---|

| `users` | Passengers and drivers (role field differentiates them) |

| `driver\_info` | License no, vehicle no, approval status — linked to users |

| `bookings` | All ride requests and their status lifecycle |

| `fcm\_tokens` | Push notification tokens per user |

| `admins` | Separate admin accounts for the web panel |



\### Step 2 — PHP REST API (`piatmove-api/`)



Thin PHP router, no framework. Endpoints map exactly to what the Android `ApiService.kt` expects.



\*\*All API endpoints:\*\*



| Method | Endpoint | Role | Description |

|---|---|---|---|

| POST | `/auth/register` | public | Register passenger or driver |

| POST | `/auth/login` | public | Login, returns JWT token |

| POST | `/bookings` | passenger | Create a new ride request |

| GET | `/bookings` | any | List bookings (role-filtered) |

| GET | `/bookings/{id}` | any | Get a single booking |

| GET | `/passenger/history` | passenger | Ride history |

| POST | `/bookings/{id}/cancel` | passenger | Cancel a ride request |

| GET | `/driver/requests` | driver | See pending ride requests |

| POST | `/driver/accept/{id}` | driver | Accept a ride |

| POST | `/driver/reject/{id}` | driver | Reject a ride |

| POST | `/driver/start/{id}` | driver | Start a ride |

| POST | `/driver/complete/{id}` | driver | Complete a ride |

| PUT | `/driver/location` | driver | Update GPS coordinates |

| PUT | `/driver/status` | driver | Toggle online/offline |

| PUT | `/user/fcm-token` | any | Register push notification token |

| GET | `/admin/users` | admin | List all users |

| GET | `/admin/drivers/pending` | admin | List pending driver approvals |

| GET | `/admin/bookings` | admin | List all bookings |

| PUT | `/admin/driver/approve/{id}` | admin | Approve a driver |

| PUT | `/admin/driver/reject/{id}` | admin | Reject a driver |

| PUT | `/admin/user/activate/{id}` | admin | Activate a user |

| PUT | `/admin/user/deactivate/{id}` | admin | Deactivate a user |

| DELETE | `/admin/user/{id}` | admin | Delete a user |



\*\*Every response follows the same JSON shape\*\* (matches `ApiResponse.kt`):

```json

{ "success": true, "data": ..., "message": "..." }

```



Auth uses \*\*JWT Bearer tokens\*\* for Android apps.



\*\*API folder structure:\*\*

```

piatmove-api/

├── config/

│   └── database.php          ← DB credentials

├── middleware/

│   └── auth.php              ← JWT verification

├── routes/

│   ├── auth.php              ← register, login

│   ├── bookings.php          ← booking CRUD

│   ├── driver.php            ← driver actions

│   ├── passenger.php         ← passenger history

│   ├── user.php              ← FCM token update

│   └── admin.php             ← admin endpoints

├── helpers/

│   └── response.php          ← json\_success() / json\_error() helpers

└── index.php                 ← router entry point

```



\### Step 3 — PHP Admin Panel (`PiatMoveAdmin/`)



Web dashboard with `$\_SESSION` auth (separate from JWT).



\*\*Admin panel folder structure:\*\*

```

PiatMoveAdmin/

├── config.php                ← DB credentials, base URL

├── index.php                 ← Admin login page

├── dashboard.php             ← Overview: users, drivers, bookings

├── users.php                 ← List passengers, search, deactivate

├── drivers.php               ← Approve/reject drivers

├── bookings.php              ← All bookings with filters

├── includes/

│   ├── auth.php              ← Session guard (included on every page)

│   ├── db.php                ← PDO connection

│   ├── header.php            ← Nav sidebar + page header

│   └── footer.php

└── assets/

&#x20;   ├── css/

&#x20;   │   └── admin.css

&#x20;   └── js/

&#x20;       └── admin.js

```
